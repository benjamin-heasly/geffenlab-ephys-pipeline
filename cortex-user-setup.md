# Cortex User Setup

This doc should help you configure your local lab machine and your cortex user account for running Geffen lab pipelines with Nextflow.

When you're done here please see [cortex-first-run.md](./cortex-first-run.md) to try a pipeline run with known data.
This should validate your setup and indicate how to run other data as well.

# Overview

Our workflow has a few steps to it which will run from local lab machines or cortex:
 - Uploading data to cortex runs from a local lab machine, using a Python script, from the local terminal.
 - Processing pipelines run on cortex, using a Python script, from a remote desktop session.
 - Manual cluser curation with Phy runs on cortex, using the interactive Phy GUI, from a remote desktop session.
 - Downloading logs and results runs on a local lab machine, using a Python script, from the local terminal.

The steps below should help you set up both your local lab machine and your Cortex user account.

# Your local lab machine

Let's set up your local lab machine for uploading data and downloading logs and pipeline results.
These instructions assume you're using Windows and WSL (Linux that runs within Windows).
Regular Linux and macOS should work too, but would require some adjustments to these steps.

## local WSL

It will be useful to set up [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) on your local Windows machine.
"WSL" stands for "Windows Subsystem for Linux".
It's a Windows feature that provides a full Linux environment running within and alongside Windows.
Working from a Linux environment means the local and cortex environments and command languages will be the same.

To install WSL find Windows Powershell in the Start menu, open a Powershell window, and type:

```
wsl --install
```

This will take a few minutes then prompt you to reboot the machine.  After rebooting, open Powershell again and type:

```
wsl --install Ubuntu-24.04
```

This will make WSL use Ubuntu by default -- similar to cortex.  When prompted, set up a default Linux user for WSL.  Use the same credentials as the Windows machine.  Perhaps:

```
user: labuser
password: *******
```

Going forward, whenever you need to start WSL, open a Powershell window and type:

```
wsl
```

From there you'll be working in Linux environment and you're ready to run all the commands below.

## local Conda

We can use [Conda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/conda) to manage dependencies on the lab machine and on cortex.
To install Conda in your local WSL environment:

```
cd ~
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py311_24.5.0-0-Linux-x86_64.sh -O miniconda.sh
chmod +x ./miniconda.sh 
./miniconda.sh 
# Follow the prompts.
# Choose "yes" to automatically initialize conda for shell.
```

To finish installing conda you'll need to log out from WSL and log in again.

```
# from WSL
exit
```

```
# from Powershell
wsl
```

Verify that conda is installed in your WSL environment.

```
conda --version
# expect conda 24.5.0
```

## local Conda environment

With conda installed we can create our own conda environment for running lab Python scripts.
The environment is defined here in this repo in [geffen-pipelines.yml](./geffen-pipelines.yml).
To create and activate the environment in WSL:

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/benjamin-heasly/geffenlab-ephys-pipeline.git
conda env create -f geffenlab-ephys-pipeline/geffen-pipelines.yml
conda activate geffen-pipelines
```

Check that the environment is active and has the expected version of Python

```
python --version
# expect Python 3.13.5
```

With this environment in place, you'll be set up to upload to and dowload from cortex, as in [cortex-moving-data.md](./cortex-moving-data.md).

# Your cortex user account

Let's set up your cortex user account for running pipelines and curating with Phy.

## cortex remote desktop connection

You'll need to already have a cortex user account and be able to log in.
You might find the [Getting started canvas](https://pesaranlab.slack.com/docs/T0481N8KH0A/F09E97B31J7) helpful, on the brainsadmin Slack channel.

In Windows you can find Remote Desktop Connection in the Start menu.
Open this, use `Computer:` `128.91.19.199` for cortex, and press `Connect`.

You should get a window that says `Login to cortex`.
Fill in your cortex user name and password, and press `OK`.

You should get an Ubuntu Desktop!
You might be prompted to do first-time Ubuntu user setup.
You can chose "skip" or "proceed" to get passed this.

## cortex remote desktop settings

By default Ubuntu will turn off the remote screen after 5 minutes of inactivity.
This is unhelpful and distracting for remote desktop!
You might be able to disable this:
 - Choose `Settings` from the system meny in the upper right.
 - Choose `Power` on the left side of the settings window.
 - Click on `Screen Blank` and choose `Never`.

## cortex terminal

We have a full desktop, but we'll still need to run commands from a terminal.
You can get a terminal in your desktop session by choosing:
 - Click `Activities` in the upper left.
 - Click `Show Applications` in the bottom right (menu should appear).
 - Choose `Terminal`.

To make this slightly quicker next time, you can:
 - Click `Activities` again.
 - Right-click on the `Terminal` icon.
 - Choose `Pin to dash`.

NOTE: you should be able to cut-and-paste commands into your remote terminal on cortex by right-clicking in the terminal window.

## cortex enable rootless Docker

Our pipelines use Docker to run steps in version-controlled, isolated environments with all their own code and dependencies.
Docker is already installed on Cortex, but you may need to do some one-time steup.

See the brainsadmin Slack channel and find the canvas with instructions for [Rootles Docker](https://pesaranlab.slack.com/docs/T0481N8KH0A/F09JMHTJKA6).
Follow the instructions in this document.

The process will go somethign like this:
 - Ask ask Bijan or Jarl for admin help setting up rootless docker.
 - Tell them your cortex user name.
 - As admins they will do the first part, adding your user to the system config files `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid`.
 - When they are done, you can run `dockerd-rootless-setuptool.sh install --force` yourself.

## cortex test Docker

With rootless Docker all set up, verify you can run Docker containers.

Run this command:

```
docker run --rm hello-world
```

Expect output like this:

```
# Hello from Docker!
# This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
# etc...
```

## cortex test Docker GPU support

Verify that your docker containers will have access to the GPUs on cortex.

Run this command:

```
docker run --rm --gpus all ubuntu nvidia-smi
```

Expect output like this, indicating the existence of several NVIDIA GPUs:

```

```

## cortex test Docker graphics support

Verify that your Docker containers will be able to run interactive graphical applications (like Phy).

Run this command:

```
docker run --rm --env DISPLAY --volume /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix ferri/xeyes:alpine
```

Expect a graphical window to appear with a title like "xeyes".
The window should contain two silly eyeballs that look at the mouse cursor and follow it as it moves.
You can close the window by clicking the `x` any time.

## cortex Conda

We can use [Conda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/conda) to manage dependencies on cortex, just like we did on your local lab machine.
To install conda for your cortex user run the following in a terminal on your cortex remote desktop:

```
cd ~
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py311_24.5.0-0-Linux-x86_64.sh -O miniconda.sh
chmod +x ./miniconda.sh 
./miniconda.sh 
# Follow the prompts.
# Choose "yes" to automatically initialize conda for shell.
```

To finish installing conda you'll need to log out from your terminal, then open a new one.

```
# from cortex terminal
exit
```

Open a new terminal on your cortex remote desktop, via `Activities` in the upper left.

```
# from new cortex terminal
conda --version
# expect conda 24.5.0
```

## cortex Conda environment

With conda installed we can create our own conda environment for running Nextflow pipelines.
The environment is defined here in this repo in [geffen-pipelines.yml](./geffen-pipelines.yml).
It's the same environment we used above, for your local lab machine.
To create and activate the environment on cortex:

```
cd /vol/cortex/cd4/geffenlab/nextflow/geffenlab-ephys-pipeline
conda env create -f geffen-pipelines.yml
conda activate geffen-pipelines
```

Verify that the environment is active and has the expected version of Java installed:

```
java -version
# expect openjdk version "17.0.14" 2025-01-21 LTS
```

After all of this, you should be able to go on to [cortex-first-run.md](./cortex-first-run.md) to try a pipeline run with known data.

# Other cortex setup for Geffen lab

In addition to your own user setup above, we had some setup on cortex for the whole lab.
You don't need to run the steps below yourself, but we do want the lab to have this documentation.

## data directories

The Geffen lab is assigned the following storage directory on cortex: `/vol/cortex/cd4/geffenlab/`.

We created several subdirectories to organized things:
 - `/vol/cortex/cd4/geffenlab/nextflow`: pipelines code, Nextflow executable, and Nextflow logs and working directories (shared by all lab members)
 - `/vol/cortex/cd4/geffenlab/raw_data`: raw nerual and behavioral data uploaded from lab machines (subdirectories per experimenter, subject, and session date)
 - `/vol/cortex/cd4/geffenlab/processed_data`: intermediate pipeline outputs and logs (subdirectories per experimenter, subject, and session date)
 - `/vol/cortex/cd4/geffenlab/analysis`: pipeline results, downloadable figures and data pickles (subdirectories per experimenter, subject, and session date)

## Nextflow

We installed the [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) pipeline tool into the geffenlab `nextflow/` subdirectory.

```
cd /vol/cortex/cd4/geffenlab/nextflow
wget https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow/releases/download/v25.04.6/nextflow-25.04.6-dist
chmod +x nextflow-25.04.6-dist
```

Verify that nextflow is working:

```
cd /vol/cortex/cd4/geffenlab/nextflow
conda activate geffen-pipelines
./nextflow-25.04.6-dist -version
```

Expect output like this:

```
#      N E X T F L O W
#      version 24.10.6 build 5937
#      created 23-04-2025 16:53 UTC (12:53 EDT)
#      cite doi:10.1038/nbt.3820
#      http://nextflow.io
```

## pipeline code

We're using two Nexftlow pipelines:
 - the [AIND ephys pipeline](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/aind-ephys-pipeline) for spike sorting and quality metrics
 - our [Geffen lab ephys pipeline](https://github.com/benjamin-heasly/geffenlab-ephys-pipeline) for combining data modalities and producing summary figures and pickles

We cloned these two Git repos into the geffenlab `nextflow/` subdirectory.

```
cd /vol/cortex/cd4/geffenlab/nextflow
git clone https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/aind-ephys-pipeline.git
git clone https://github.com/benjamin-heasly/geffenlab-ephys-pipeline.git
```

### AIND pipeline version

The [AIND ephys pipeline](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/aind-ephys-pipeline) is actively developed and has different versions over time.
We've been working with version [5c87528](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/aind-ephys-pipeline/tree/5c875288a2e485b4bdf1b61f4ad48c648691246d), from 21 October 2025.
We should stick with this version until we need to change it, and we're able to spend time working out any issues that arise from the change.

Verify the version of the AIND pipeline:

```
cd /vol/cortex/cd4/geffenlab/nextflow/aind-ephys-pipeline
git log
```

Expect the log to start with `commit 5c87528`:

```
commit 5c875288a2e485b4bdf1b61f4ad48c648691246d (HEAD -> main, origin/main, origin/HEAD)
Merge: 6d8216d 893eb25
Author: Alessio Buccino <alessio.buccino@alleninstitute.org>
Date:   Tue Oct 21 15:15:29 2025 +0200

    Merge pull request #66 from AllenNeuralDynamics/fix-nwb-ecephys-electrodes
    
    Update NWB ecephys version
```

#### AIND QUALITY_CONTROL version change

We have one local change to call out, within the AIND pipeline code repo.
This is a change to the [capsule_versions](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/aind-ephys-pipeline/blob/main/pipeline/capsule_versions.env#L10C17-L10C57) file, which declares versions of code used in individual processing steps.

The default code and version for the "quality control" step is [aind-ephys-processing-qc version c18647a](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/aind-ephys-processing-qc/tree/c18647a0246ab6f3d59b4aacf52b3462e56fa20c).
This version contains a bug for recordings with multiple segments.
The "quality control" code itself has been updated to fix this bug, but the fixed version is not yet the default version used by the overall AIND pipeline.
We made a code change locally, to declare [aind-ephys-processing-qc version 99784c2](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/aind-ephys-processing-qc/tree/99784c262c1d6a9af7a8a28ec380278db403fc17), instead.

Verify the "quality control" code version used by the AIND pipeline:

```
cd /vol/cortex/cd4/geffenlab/nextflow/aind-ephys-pipeline
git diff
```

Expect only one file modified: `pipeline/capsule_versions.env`.
Expect the diff to show one line changed:

```
-QUALITY_CONTROL=c18647a0246ab6f3d59b4aacf52b3462e56fa20c
+QUALITY_CONTROL=99784c262c1d6a9af7a8a28ec380278db403fc17
```

We'd prefer not to make changes like this or to keep track of them!
Hopefully the main pipeline will be updated, and we can update to a version that we can use whole, as-is.

### Geffen lab pipeline version

We've been actively developing and debugging our own [Geffen lab ephys pipeline](https://github.com/benjamin-heasly/geffenlab-ephys-pipeline).
When things are settled, we should choose a release tag to check out on cortex, and use for all processing.
Meanwhile, we should try to keep this repo up to date with the latest on GitHub.

Check what version is currently on cortex:

```
cd /vol/cortex/cd4/geffenlab/nextflow/geffenlab-ephys-pipeline
git log
```

GitHub should be the source of truth for this pipeline.
We should not have local changes on cortex that are not captured in version control on GitHub.
Otherwise, we won't know how our data was processed and we won't be sure the processing can be reproduced.

Verify no local changes on cortex:

```
cd /vol/cortex/cd4/geffenlab/nextflow/geffenlab-ephys-pipeline
git status
```

Expect output like this:

```
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```
